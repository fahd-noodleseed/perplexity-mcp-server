## Overview

The Noodle Perplexity MCP acts as a bridge, allowing applications (MCP Clients) that understand the Model Context Protocol (MCP)‚Äîlike advanced AI assistants (LLMs), IDE extensions, or custom research tools‚Äîto interact directly and efficiently with the Perplexity AI API.

Instead of complex, one-off API integrations, your tools can leverage this server to:

- **Automate Research**: Enable agents to perform quick lookups or deep-dive research programmatically.
- **Enhance AI Reasoning**: Provide LLMs with up-to-date, verifiable information from the web to ground their responses.
- **Integrate Search into Workflows**: Seamlessly add search-augmented generation to any AI-driven task.

Built on the robust `mcp-ts-template`, this server provides a standardized, secure, and efficient way to expose Perplexity's functionality via the MCP standard.

> **Developer Note**: This repository includes a [.clinerules](.clinerules) file that serves as a developer cheat sheet for your LLM coding agent with quick reference for the codebase patterns, file locations, and code snippets.

## Features

### Core Utilities

Leverages the robust utilities provided by the `mcp-ts-template`:

- **Logging**: Structured, configurable logging with file rotation and optional MCP notifications.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error processing with standardized `McpError` types.
- **Configuration**: Environment variable loading (`dotenv`) with Zod validation.
- **Input Validation/Sanitization**: Uses `zod` for schema validation and a dedicated sanitization utility.
- **Request Context**: Operation tracking and correlation via unique request IDs using `AsyncLocalStorage`.
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing enforced by TypeScript and Zod schemas.
- **HTTP Transport**: High-performance HTTP server using **Hono**, featuring session management and CORS support.
- **Authentication**: Robust authentication layer supporting JWT and OAuth 2.1.

### Perplexity Integration

- **Triple Model Support**: Specialized tools using fixed, optimized models - `perplexity_ask` (sonar-pro) for comprehensive research, `perplexity_think_and_analyze` (sonar-reasoning-pro) for logical reasoning, and `perplexity_deep_research` (sonar-deep-research) for exhaustive multi-source research.
- **Advanced Domain Filtering**: Powerful domain control with four filtering modes - Allowlist (include only specific domains), Denylist (exclude domains with `-` prefix), URL-level filtering (target specific pages), and SEC filings (special `["sec"]` value). Supports up to 20 domains/URLs per request.
- **Advanced Search Control**: Fine-grained control over search parameters, including recency filters, date range filtering, and academic source prioritization.
- **Cost Tracking & Transparency**: Detailed cost breakdown with 6 itemized components (input/output/citation/reasoning tokens, search queries), helping manage expenses and understand API usage.
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Optional `showThinking` parameter and automatic `<think>` block parsing to expose model reasoning process.
- **Resilient API Client**: A dedicated service for interacting with the Perplexity API, featuring built-in error handling and request/response logging.

## Tools

The Perplexity MCP Server provides three specialized tools, each optimized with a specific model for different use cases:

| Tool Name                    | Model Used | Description                                          | Key Arguments                                                                               |
| :--------------------------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `perplexity_ask`             | sonar-pro  | Get comprehensive, well-researched answers from multiple sources. **Supports file attachments** for multimodal analysis (PDFs, documents, images). Best for complex questions requiring detailed analysis and thorough coverage.     | `query`, `files?`, `search_recency_filter?`, `search_domain_filter?`, `search_mode?`, `return_related_questions?` |
| `perplexity_think_and_analyze` | sonar-reasoning-pro | Perform logical reasoning and step-by-step analysis. **Supports file attachments** for code analysis, debugging, and document review. Best for problem-solving, mathematical calculations, code analysis, and systematic thinking. | `query`, `files?`, `search_recency_filter?`, `search_domain_filter?`, `search_mode?`, `showThinking?` |
| `perplexity_deep_research` | sonar-deep-research | Conduct exhaustive, multi-source deep research generating comprehensive 10,000+ word reports. Best for academic research, market analysis, and due diligence. | `query`, `reasoning_effort?`, `search_recency_filter?`, `search_domain_filter?`, `search_mode?`, `return_related_questions?` |

_Note: All tools support comprehensive error handling, advanced domain filtering, and return structured JSON responses with detailed cost tracking. `perplexity_ask` and `perplexity_think_and_analyze` now support file attachments (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, PNG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF) for multimodal analysis._

### Advanced Domain Filtering

All three Perplexity tools support powerful domain filtering via the `search_domain_filter` parameter, enabling precise control over search sources.

#### Four Filtering Modes

**1. Allowlist Mode (Include Only Specific Domains)**
```json
{
  "search_domain_filter": ["nasa.gov", "wikipedia.org", "space.com"]
}
```
- Only searches the specified domains
- Use simple domain names without `https://` or `www.`
- Main domain includes all subdomains automatically

**2. Denylist Mode (Exclude Specific Domains)**
```json
{
  "search_domain_filter": ["-pinterest.com", "-reddit.com", "-quora.com"]
}
```
- Excludes specified domains from search results
- Prefix domain with `-` to exclude
- Useful for filtering out noise and low-quality sources

**3. URL-Level Filtering (Target Specific Pages)**
```json
{
  "search_domain_filter": [
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess",
    "https://chess.com"
  ]
}
```
- Use complete URLs with protocol for page-level control
- Can target specific articles or pages
- Can also exclude specific pages with `-` prefix

**4. SEC Filings (Special Value)**
```json
{
  "search_domain_filter": ["sec"]
}
```
- Special value `"sec"` searches SEC regulatory filings
- Includes 10-K (annual), 10-Q (quarterly), and 8-K (current) reports
- Ideal for financial analysis and due diligence

#### Common Use Cases

**Healthcare Research:**
```json
{ "search_domain_filter": ["nih.gov", "who.int", "cdc.gov", "nejm.org"] }
```

**Finance & SEC Filings:**
```json
{ "search_domain_filter": ["sec", "bloomberg.com", "wsj.com", "ft.com"] }
```

**Academic Research:**
```json
{ "search_domain_filter": ["arxiv.org", "scholar.google.com", "pnas.org", "nature.com"] }
```

**Legal Research:**
```json
{ "search_domain_filter": ["justia.com", "findlaw.com", "law.cornell.edu"] }
```

#### Best Practices

- **Maximum 20 domains/URLs** per request
- **Cannot mix** allowlist and denylist modes in a single request
- Use **simple domain names** for broad filtering across entire sites
- Use **complete URLs** for granular page-level control
- Test URL accessibility before adding to allowlist

## Development
